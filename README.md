# Autismic
Empowering neurodivergent individuals through inclusive digital tools. This open-source project aims to develop an application tailored to the needs of neurodivergent users, focusing on accessibility, customization, and cognitive support. Whether you're navigating executive function challenges, sensory sensitivities.

That’s a wonderful initiative, Zack! It sounds like you're building a Python-based application to support the development of autistic individuals using interactive images. Here's a clearer way to describe your project, which you could use in your README or project documentation:

🧠 Autism Support App with Interactive Images

This Python application is designed to assist individuals on the autism spectrum in their personal development through the use of **interactive visual tools**. The app focuses on:

🖼️ **Visual Learning**: Uses images and icons to support communication and understanding.
🧩 **Interactive Activities**: Engaging tasks that help with cognitive, emotional, and social development.
🛠️ **Built with Python**: Simple, open-source codebase that can be extended by educators, therapists, or developers.

🌟 Key Features

Visual schedules and routines
Emotion recognition with image prompts
Drag-and-drop matching games
Customizable image sets for different learning goals

👥 Who It's For

Autistic children and adults
Parents and caregivers
Special education teachers and therapists
If you’d like, I can help you write the actual Python code for one of the features—like an image-based matching game or a visual schedule. Just let me know what you'd likto build next!
